              <h2>Why we think centralization has gone wrong</h2>
              <p>
                One thing human value a lot is privacy. We believe privacy
                basically means to keep things without any body,checking or
                changing them. Ever since the advancement of technology
                people have moved from storing things (hardcopy) in files and bags
                to keeping/storing them or information about them (things they
                want to keep) in computers (softcopy). As you might have known
                or experienced information stored directly into the computer
                memory can get lost easily through hacking, computer
                theft,computer virus or even physical
                damage.
                
              </p>
              <div>

            </div>
           
          
              <p>
                We realized that we could help make the
                storage system of the current generation better, by using the
                available web3 api (ethers),blockchain solidity and react
                (frontend) and Yes we did we made a system so nice that you can
                archive your data for millions of years because of the
                immmurability (never changing nature) of the smart contacts and
                the decebtralized system at large.
              </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                It is not just the immutability of the decentralized project that
                makes it amazing,it also gibes users access to their data any day
                at any time they want (No weekend off and no closing time like
                banks).
              </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                This means users don't need to talk to anubody to see their data
                or ask anybody for an otp in order to login or access what they
                have stored,the only thing needed is their wallet which will serve
                as a unique identifier and some verification to confirm whether no
                one gained access to their wallet in order to steal their
                information.
