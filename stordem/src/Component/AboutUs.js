            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                We are an IPFs enabled dApp(decentralized app). We simply connect Web2
                data to WEb3 storage to ensure that your data is safe via
                decentralization{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
                Decentralization is everything the name says, if "De" is a prefix of a word that already makes complete sense in English it
                usually means no,none or not and centralization is basically the process of depending or revolving around a main or center figure,
                so decentralization in simple terms means "no center figure".
                <p>"PIC HERE"</p>
                It is the process of killing the center figure (sorry that was a joke),
                nobody is killing anybody it just eliminates the need for depending on a site owner.
                Imagine working in a company with a flexible boss that accepts and implements everybody's opinion but never allows employees to cheat one another,
                this is literally like you being the boss of yourself, this may seem amazing and impossible but decebtralization is ten times or
                even hundred times better than the example I gave above.

                One thing human value a lot is privacy. We believe privacy basically means to keep things without any body,checking or changing them.
                No matter how free or jovial a person is he/she would not like a person touching his/her cherished belongings without
                permission and ever since the advancement of technology people have moved from storing things (hardcopy) in files and bags
                to keeping/storing them or information about them (things they want to keep) in computers (softcopy),but as you might have known or experienced
                information stored directly into the computer memory can get lost easily through hacking, computer theft,computer virus and
                the most common one in Africa physical damage.
                <p>"PIC HERE"</p>
                People had to find solutions to some of these problems by creating a medium to store things out of the
                memory amd this was called the cloud storage system (cloud(s)). Most clouds are centralized storage system that gives some space to users (usually for free) with the
                assurance that the files will be safe. Most clouds have been trying but they haven't been able to totally solve problems like hacking and as we already know
                the cloud belongs to somebody (a center figure) he/she (the owner) might wish to pry/check what some specific users uploaded (Not all human are reliable) or
                he/she might want to stop the site from operating because of reasons best known to him/her.

                Centralized network can be censored or mutated(tampered with). As hopes are on the
                storage provider to secure data, but we can't always be sure that the
                operator would live up to this; as anything can happen. Hacking, data
                policy changes, corrupted software and many more. <br />
                That's why we've brought a solution that keeps you in control to help
                you secure your future by storing your data.

                According to a report published by Holon
                <q>Web3 storage could solve the global data crisis</q> <br /> It also
                went futher to say
                <q>
                    The current centralized data storage model wonâ€™t be able to handle
                    future data demand
                </q>

            </p>
            <p>The speech above made us realize that we could help make
                the storage system of the current generation better, by using
                the available web3 api (ethers),blockchain solidity and react (frontend) and
                Yes we did we made a system so nice that you can archive your data for millions of years
                because of the immmurability (never changing nature) of the smart contacts and the decebtralized
                system at large.

                It is not just the immutability of the decentralized project that makes it amazing,it also gibes users access to their data
                any day at any time they want (No weekend off and no closing time like banks).
            </p>
            <p className="fact">
                According to an article by the author of the Blockchain Technology and Business book (Akash Takyar) {" "}
                <q>
                    Web3 gives users full control over their data through
                    decentralization but they retain full access to storage and
                    communication
                </q>.
                <p>"PIC HERE"</p>
                This means users don't need to talk to anubody to see their data or
                ask anybody for an otp in order to login or access what they have stored,the only thing needed is
                their wallet which will serve as a unique identifier and some verification to confirm whether no one gained access
                to their wallet in order to steal their information.
